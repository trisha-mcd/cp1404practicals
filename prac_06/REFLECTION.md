## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I push through even if I get frustrated at the code instead of giving up for the day.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

Allow myself time to calm down before attempting my try again.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Working full days on the code.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Take time to process the information on lectures.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

Put more details into the powerpoint slide shows so I dont have to go through every lecture video to find the one thing.
